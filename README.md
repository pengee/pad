> One binary. Local-first. No accounts required. Pad gives you a CLI, a web UI, and an AI agent skill — all backed by SQLite, all running on your machine. Your project data never leaves your laptop.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/dashboard.png" width="900" alt="Pad dashboard showing collection summaries, active work, an active plan with progress, and a recent activity feed" />
</p>

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install PerpetualSoftware/tap/pad
cd your-project
pad init                    # configure, auth, workspace, AI skill — all in one
pad server open             # opens the web UI at localhost:7777
```

`pad init` is the smart entry point — it auto-detects what's needed, walks you through each step, and is safe to re-run anytime (it skips finished steps and prints a status summary).

Then, in a fresh agent session in your project, say:

```
/pad onboard
```

Your new workspace ships with the canonical `onboard` playbook auto-activated. The agent walks an interview, inspects your codebase if it has shell access, and adapts your workspace's collections, conventions, roles, and playbooks to match the project. It's the fastest way to go from empty workspace to "okay, this is mine."

## Why Pad?

Tools like Linear, Jira, and Notion are built for teams on the cloud. Pad is built for **developers on their machine** — and for the AI agents working alongside them.

| | Pad | Linear / Jira | Notion |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | `pad init` | Create account, invite team, configure | Create account, pick template |
| **AI agents** | Native `/pad` skill for 7+ tools | Third-party integrations | Third-party integrations |
| **Data** | Local SQLite, you own it | Their cloud | Their cloud |
| **Offline** | Full functionality | Read-only cache at best | Limited |
| **CLI** | First-class | Afterthought | None |
| **Price** | Free, open source | Per-seat pricing | Per-seat pricing |

## Features

### For Developers

**CLI that doesn't get in your way.** Create tasks, search items, check status — without leaving the terminal.

```bash
pad item create task "Fix OAuth redirect" --priority high
pad item create idea "Real-time collaboration" --category infrastructure
pad item list tasks --status in-progress
pad item search "authentication"
pad project dashboard                   # Project dashboard
pad project next                        # What should I work on?
pad server info                         # How this client is connected to Pad
```

**Web UI that stays out of your way.** A clean, dark-themed interface at `localhost:7777` with:

- **Board, list, and table views** — drag-and-drop between status columns
- **Keyboard navigation** — `j`/`k` to move, `Enter` to open, `Esc` to go back, `Cmd+K` to search
- **Rich text editor** — Tiptap-based with markdown, formatting toolbar, and auto-save
- **Wiki-links** — type `[[Title]]` to link between items
- **Real-time updates** — agent creates a task in the terminal, it appears in the browser instantly (via SSE)
- **Dashboard** — collection overview, active work, plan tracking, activity feed

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/board.png" width="900" alt="Pad tasks board view: kanban columns for Open, In-Progress, Done, Cancelled with task cards in each" />
</p>

### For AI Agents

**Your agent becomes a project partner.** Install the `/pad` skill once, and your AI coding tool can read, create, and update project items through natural language.

```bash
pad agent install        # Auto-detects your tools and installs the skill
```

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, **Codex**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Amazon Q**, and **JetBrains Junie**.

Then just talk to your project:

```
> /pad what should I work on next?
> /pad I finished the OAuth fix
> /pad create a task to add rate limiting
> /pad let's brainstorm about the API redesign
```

**Conventions and playbooks** teach agents how your project works:

- **Conventions** — trigger-based rules like "run tests before marking a task done" or "use conventional commits"
- **Playbooks** — multi-step workflows like "when implementing a feature: read the spec, create a branch, write tests first, then implement". Playbooks can declare a kebab-case `invocation_slug` so users can invoke them directly: `/pad ship PLAN-42`, `/pad release 0.5.0`. Fresh `startup` workspaces ship a generic `ship` playbook out of the box.

```bash
pad item create convention "Run tests before completing tasks" \
  --field trigger=on-task-complete \
  --field scope=all \
  --field priority=must
```

Agents load relevant conventions automatically. All agent actions are attributed in the activity feed, so you always know what the AI changed.

**Onboard agents to a new codebase:**

Open an agent session in the workspace directory and run `/pad onboard`. The agent walks an interview, detects your build/test/CI tooling, and adapts your workspace's collections, conventions, roles, and playbooks to match the project. Works for any agent that speaks Pad — Claude Code, MCP-only agents, etc.

### Collections & Custom Fields

Pad organizes work into **collections** — typed containers with structured fields.

**Built-in collections:**

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Tasks** | Work items with status, priority, assignee, effort, due date |
| **Ideas** | Feature ideas with impact and category |
| **Plans** | Project milestones with progress tracking |
| **Docs** | Documentation, decisions, reference material |
| **Conventions** | Project rules that guide agent behavior |
| **Playbooks** | Multi-step workflows for agents to follow |

**Create your own** with typed fields — select, text, date, number, url, relation, checkbox:

```bash
pad collection create "Bug Reports" \
  --fields "severity:select:low,medium,high,critical; browser:text; reproducible:checkbox"
```

Items get reference numbers automatically (`TASK-5`, `BUG-12`) and can be moved between collections with field migration.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install PerpetualSoftware/tap/pad
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerpetualSoftware/pad
cd pad
make build
cp pad ~/.local/bin/   # or /usr/local/bin/
```

Requires Go 1.26+ and Node.js 22+.

The `go install github.com/PerpetualSoftware/pad/cmd/pad@latest` path is not supported for the full Pad binary, because the web UI must be built and embedded during the source build.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:7777:7777 -v pad-data:/data ghcr.io/perpetualsoftware/pad
```

This publishes Pad to `localhost:7777` on the host machine, which is the recommended default for local use.

**Single user, more than one device?** Publish to all interfaces so you can reach Pad from your phone, tablet, or another machine on the same LAN, Tailscale network, or home VPN:

```bash
docker run -p 7777:7777 -v pad-data:/data ghcr.io/perpetualsoftware/pad
```

For multi-instance deployments, Pad supports Postgres + Redis via `docker-compose.yml` — see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the full setup.

### Binary Download

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/PerpetualSoftware/pad/releases).

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up Pad

```bash
cd ~/projects/myapp
pad init "My App"
```

`pad init` is the smart entry point that handles everything in one command:

- Configures this client's connection (local server, remote, or Docker)
- Auto-starts the local server
- Creates the first admin account on a fresh local install (Docker / remote hosts run `pad auth setup` on the server instead)
- Logs you in if needed
- Creates or links a workspace for the current directory (writes `.pad.toml`)
- Installs the `/pad` skill for any AI tools detected in the project

Run from your project root. Safe to re-run anytime — it skips finished steps and prints a status summary if nothing's needed.

**Choose a template** with `--template`, or omit it for an interactive picker grouped by category (Software / People / …):

```bash
pad workspace init --list-templates                   # See the full catalog grouped by category
pad init "My App" --template scrum                    # Scrum-style with sprints
pad init "My App" --template product                  # Product management focused
pad init "My Hiring" --template hiring                # Company-side: requisitions, candidates, interview loops, feedback
pad init "Job Search" --template interviewing         # Candidate-side: applications, interviews, companies, contacts
```

Pad ships templates for software (startup / scrum / product), people workflows (hiring, interviewing), and has reserved categories for research, content, operations, and personal use so the same project-management primitives fit well beyond code projects.

### 2. Start working

```bash
# From the CLI
pad item create task "Set up CI pipeline" --priority high
pad item create idea "Add WebSocket support" --category infrastructure
pad project dashboard

# From the web UI
pad server open              # Opens localhost:7777 in your browser

# From your AI agent
# Just use /pad in Claude Code, Cursor, etc.
```

### 3. Teach your agents the rules

In an agent session inside the workspace:

```
/pad onboard
```

The agent walks an interview, detects your tooling, and adapts the workspace's collections, conventions, roles, and playbooks. To browse the library directly:

```bash
pad library list --type conventions  # Pre-built conventions you can adopt
pad library list --type playbooks    # Pre-built multi-step workflows
```

### 4. Optional — connect a desktop AI app via MCP

Pad ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so Claude Desktop, Cursor, or
Windsurf can manage items, plans, ideas, and dependencies as native tools, read
workspace state by URL, and load multi-step workflows as prompts.

```bash
pad mcp install claude-desktop   # or: cursor, windsurf, --all
# Restart the client; pad shows up as the "pad" MCP server.
```

**Tool catalog (v0.4)** — eight resource × action tools plus `pad_set_workspace` (nine total), no flat verb explosion:

| Tool | Actions |
|---|---|
| `pad_item` | `create`, `update`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `move`, `link`, `unlink`, `deps`, `star`, `unstar`, `starred`, `comment`, `list-comments`, `bulk-update`, `note`, `decide` |
| `pad_workspace` | `list`, `members`, `invite`, `storage`, `audit-log` |
| `pad_collection` | `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` |
| `pad_project` | `dashboard`, `next`, `standup`, `changelog` |
| `pad_role` | `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` |
| `pad_search` | `query` |
| `pad_playbook` | `list`, `get`, `run` |
| `pad_meta` | `server-info`, `version`, `tool-surface`, `bootstrap` |
| `pad_set_workspace` | session-default workspace pinning (response embeds the bootstrap blob) |

Plus resources at `pad://workspaces`, `pad://workspace/{ws}/dashboard`,
`pad://workspace/{ws}/items`, `pad://workspace/{ws}/items/{ref}`,
`pad://workspace/{ws}/collections`, `pad://workspace/{ws}/bootstrap`,
and `pad://_meta/version`.

**Stability contract** — two version constants, both advertised in the
initialize handshake under `capabilities.experimental.padCmdhelp` and
`capabilities.experimental.padToolSurface` (and queryable at
`pad://_meta/version`):

- `cmdhelp_version: "0.1"` — CLI help-tree contract (used at dispatch time)
- `tool_surface_version: "0.4"` — MCP tool catalog contract (PLAN-1410 trimmed the bootstrap-response shape by ~40%; see `internal/mcp/version.go` for the full v0.4 changelog)

External agents pin against these so a future rename doesn't break them
silently. Errors come back as structured envelopes (`{error: {code,
message, hint, available_workspaces, ...}}`) with a closed eight-code
taxonomy.

All commands accept `--format json` for machine-readable output and `--workspace` to target a specific workspace.

### Authentication

Pad runs without authentication by default for frictionless local use. For local installs, `pad init` creates the first admin account inline. The lower-level commands are useful when you're hosting a Pad server (Docker / remote) and need to set up auth on the server host directly:

```bash
pad auth setup         # Initialize the first admin account (server host, non-local mode)
pad auth login         # Sign in
pad auth whoami        # Show current user
pad auth logout        # Sign out
```

Once a user exists, all API requests and web UI access require authentication. Credentials are stored in `~/.pad/credentials.json`. Multiple users can be invited to workspaces with role-based access control (`owner`, `editor`, `viewer`).

```bash
pad workspace members               # List workspace members
pad workspace invite user@example.com
pad workspace join <code>
```

- **Go backend** — chi router, SQLite via [modernc.org/sqlite](https://pkg.go.dev/modernc.org/sqlite) (pure Go, no CGO), FTS5 full-text search, SSE for real-time updates
- **SvelteKit frontend** — Svelte 5, Tiptap editor, drag-and-drop, adapter-static, embedded via `go:embed`
- **Single binary** — serves the API and web UI, runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Workspace-per-project** — each project gets its own workspace linked by a `.pad.toml` file

All data lives in `~/.pad/pad.db`. Your data. Your machine. No telemetry, no cloud, no accounts required.
