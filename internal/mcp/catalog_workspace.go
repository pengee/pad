// `workspace` parameter targets a specific workspace for the action
// (e.g. members of which workspace) rather than picking the session
// default. Where the action is server-wide (`list`), the param is
// ignored.

const padWorkspaceToolDescription = `Workspace operations — discovery, membership, storage, audit log, and lifecycle.

Actions:
  list       — List workspaces visible to the current user. No params; admins see all,
               regular users see their memberships.
  members    — List members + pending invitations for a workspace.
               Required: workspace.
  invite     — Invite a user to a workspace.
               Required: workspace, email.
               Optional: role (owner | editor | viewer; default editor).
  storage    — Workspace storage usage breakdown (attachments, items, total bytes).
               Required: workspace.
  audit-log  — Workspace audit log. ADMIN ONLY — non-admin users get an auth error.
               Optional: action_filter, actor, days, limit.
               Note: the underlying endpoint is global, so this returns entries
               across all workspaces filtered by the supplied params.
  create     — Create a new workspace.
               Required: name.
               Optional: slug (derived from name when omitted), template (e.g.
               "startup" / "scrum" / "blank").
               When called over an OAuth-bound MCP session whose grant has
               may_create_workspaces=true, the new workspace is auto-added to
               that connection's allow-list — usable immediately, no re-auth.
  claim      — Redeem a 6-digit claim code to add a workspace to the calling
               OAuth connection's allow-list.
               Required: workspace, code.
               Generate the code in the workspace's web UI ("Connect project"
               modal). Valid for 5–10 minutes (sliding window). Errors: 401
               invalid_code, 404 not_found (workspace doesn't exist or you're
               not a member), 412 connection_not_persisted (pre-Phase-C grant
               — re-authorize).

Use pad_workspace when an agent needs to discover, manage membership, audit
workspace activity, or bring a new/additional workspace into this connection.
For item-level operations use pad_item.`
